# Expense Tracker App

This is a basic expense tracker application built with TypeScript, React, Express, Jest, and Supertest. The main purpose of this project is to improve understanding and implementation of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Architecture principles.

## Features

- Track expenses with details such as description & amount.
- View a list of all expenses.
- Add and delete expenses.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Provides static typing and improves code quality and reliability.
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Express: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for backend development.
- Jest: JavaScript testing framework for writing unit and integration tests.
- Supertest: Super-agent driven library for testing HTTP servers.
- MongoDB (Future Implementation): NoSQL database for storing expense data.

## Improvements Left

- Refactor code for better modularity and maintainability.
- Implement MongoDB for data persistence.
- Enhance frontend UI/UX.
- Add authentication and authorization features.
- Implement more comprehensive testing.
- Implement environment variables on the frontend to manage configurations dynamically, such as API endpoints or feature toggles, without hardcoding them.
